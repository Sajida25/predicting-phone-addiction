This project investigates how teen smartphone addiction is shaped by behavioral and psychological factors, including daily screen time, sleep duration, and mental health indicators such as anxiety and depression. Using data from the **Teen Smartphone Usage and Addiction Impact Dataset** (published on Kaggle in 2022), a logistic regression model was developed to predict addiction likelihood.

Key findings reveal that each additional hour of phone use more than doubles the odds of addiction, while an extra hour of sleep lowers those odds by approximately 44%. The results emphasize the role of balanced digital habits and well-being in mitigating addiction risk among teenagers.
