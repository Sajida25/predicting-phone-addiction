## ðŸ“Š Logistic Regression Model

This section explains the logistic regression model used to predict **teen smartphone addiction** based on behavioral and psychological factors.

---

### ðŸ§® General Logistic Regression Equation

$$
\log\left( \frac{P(\text{Addicted} = 1)}{1 - P(\text{Addicted} = 1)} \right) =
\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{DailyUsage} +
\beta_2 \cdot \text{SleepHours} +
\beta_3 \cdot \text{SocialMediaTime} +
\beta_4 \cdot \text{AnxietyLevel} +
\beta_5 \cdot \text{DepressionLevel}
$$

Where:

- **DailyUsage**: Daily smartphone usage, in hours  
- **SleepHours**: Average hours of sleep per night  
- **SocialMediaTime**: Hours spent on social media per day  
- **AnxietyLevel**: Self-reported anxiety score  
- **DepressionLevel**: Self-reported depression score

### Estimated Logistic Regression Equation

The fitted model from your data yields the following equation:

$$
\log\left( \frac{P(\text{Addicted} = 1)}{1 - P(\text{Addicted} = 1)} \right) =
-2.869 + 1.111 \cdot \text{DailyUsage} -
0.580 \cdot \text{SleepHours} +
1.235 \cdot \text{SocialMediaTime} +
0.003 \cdot \text{AnxietyLevel} +
0.046 \cdot \text{DepressionLevel}
$$

This equation lets us estimate a teen's probability of addiction based on their habits and psychological state.

# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/user/Desktop/projects/teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv")

         addicted = factor(addicted))

# Fit logistic regression model

  fit(addicted ~ Daily_Usage_Hours + Sleep_Hours + Time_on_Social_Media + Anxiety_Level + Depression_Level,

## âœ… Conclusion

The logistic regression table summarizes how each predictor influences the likelihood of teen smartphone addiction:

- **Intercept (-2.869):** Represents the baseline log-odds of being addicted when all predictors are zero.
- **Daily_Usage_Hours (1.111):** A strong positive coefficient indicates that each additional hour of daily phone use significantly increases the odds of addiction.
- **Sleep_Hours (-0.580):** The negative sign suggests that more sleep is associated with **lower odds** of addiction. For each extra hour of sleep, the log-odds of addiction decrease.
- **Time_on_Social_Media (1.235):** Like daily phone use, more time on social media is a strong predictor of addiction.
- **Anxiety_Level (0.003):** This coefficient is very small and not statistically significant (*p = 0.874*), meaning anxiety level doesnâ€™t show a clear relationship with addiction in this model.
- **Depression_Level (0.046):** Though the effect is smaller, it is statistically significant (*p = 0.023*), suggesting that higher depression scores slightly increase the likelihood of addiction.

###  Key Takeaways:

- **Daily usage and social media time** are the most impactful predictors.
- **Sleep** plays a protective role against addiction.
- **Depression** matters, but **anxiety** does not appear significant in this sample.
- The p-values confirm that most predictors (except anxiety) are statistically meaningful at conventional thresholds (*p < 0.05*).

These insights can inform strategies for reducing phone addiction in teens by targeting usage habits, promoting better sleep, and supporting mental healthâ€”especially depression.
