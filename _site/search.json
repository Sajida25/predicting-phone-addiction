    "text": "Teen phone addiction is influenced by a combination of screen time, sleep habits, and psychological well-being. This project uses data from the Teen Smartphone Usage and Addiction Impact Dataset, published on Kaggle in 2022. The dataset includes information on smartphone usage, sleep duration, time spent on social media, and levels of anxiety and depression, along with an addiction score used to classify individuals as either addicted or not. We modeled addiction as a binary outcome using logistic regression, with phone usage, sleep patterns, social media time, and mental health indicators as predictors. The analysis revealed that higher phone use and greater time spent on social media significantly increase the likelihood of addiction, while longer sleep duration reduces it. Notably, each additional hour spent on the phone increases the odds of addiction by approximately three times, whereas an extra hour of sleep lowers those odds by about 44%."

    "section": "✅ Conclusion",
    "text": "✅ Conclusion\nThe logistic regression table summarizes how each predictor influences the likelihood of teen smartphone addiction:\n\nIntercept (-2.869): Represents the baseline log-odds of being addicted when all predictors are zero.\nDaily_Usage_Hours (1.111): A strong positive coefficient indicates that each additional hour of daily phone use significantly increases the odds of addiction.\nSleep_Hours (-0.580): The negative sign suggests that more sleep is associated with lower odds of addiction. For each extra hour of sleep, the log-odds of addiction decrease.\nTime_on_Social_Media (1.235): Like daily phone use, more time on social media is a strong predictor of addiction.\nAnxiety_Level (0.003): This coefficient is very small and not statistically significant (p = 0.874), meaning anxiety level doesn’t show a clear relationship with addiction in this model.\nDepression_Level (0.046): Though the effect is smaller, it is statistically significant (p = 0.023), suggesting that higher depression scores slightly increase the likelihood of addiction.\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nDaily usage and social media time are the most impactful predictors.\nSleep plays a protective role against addiction.\nDepression matters, but anxiety does not appear significant in this sample.\nThe p-values confirm that most predictors (except anxiety) are statistically meaningful at conventional thresholds (p &lt; 0.05).\n\nThese insights can inform strategies for reducing phone addiction in teens by targeting usage habits, promoting better sleep, and supporting mental health—especially depression."

The dataset contains detailed survey responses from teenagers, including variables such as daily smartphone usage, time spent on social media, sleep duration, anxiety and depression levels, and a smartphone addiction score ranging from 0 to 10.\nTo prepare the data for analysis, we performed several data cleaning steps. We removed any rows with missing or incomplete values to ensure the reliability of the logistic regression model. We also converted categorical variables like school grade and gender into appropriate factor types for modeling and visualization. The smartphone addiction score was binarized to classify individuals as “addicted” or “not addicted” based on a predefined threshold.\nThis cleaned and processed data was then used to build a logistic regression model and create various 2D and 3D visualizations that help explain the patterns and factors contributing to teen smartphone addiction."
