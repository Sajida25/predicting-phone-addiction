Hi, I'm Sajida Rehman, a Lecturer in Statistics at the Higher Education Department, Punjab. I'm passionate about learning and applying data analysis.

This project investigates teen smartphone usage and addiction patterns using logistic regression modeling and visualizations. All source code and data analysis can be found in the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/sajida25/predicting-phone-addiction).

This project was created as part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
